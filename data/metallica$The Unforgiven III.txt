how could he know this new dawn's light would change his life forever? set sail to sea, but pulled off course by the light of golden treasure was he the one causing pain with his careless dreaming? been afraid, always afraid of the things he's feeling he could just be gone he would just sail on he'll just sail on how can i be lost, if i've got nowhere to go? search for seas of gold how come it's got so cold? how can i be lost? in remembrance i relive and how can i blame you when it's me i can't forgive? these days drift on inside a fog thick and suffocating his sincking life, outside its hell inside, intoxicating he's run aground like his life water much too shallow slipping fast, down with his ship fading in the shadows now a castaway they've all gone away they've gone away how can i be lost, if i've got nowhere to go? search for seas of gold how come it's got so cold? how can i be lost? in remembrance i relive and how can i blame you when it's me i can't forgive? forgive me forgive me not why can't i forgive me? set sail to sea, but pulled off course by the light of golden treasure how could he know this new dawn's light would change his life forever? how can i be lost, if i've got nowhere to go? search for seas of gold how come it's got so cold? how can i be lost? in remembrance i relive so how can i blame you when it's me i can't forgive?
