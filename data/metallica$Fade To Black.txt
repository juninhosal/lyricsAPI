life, it seems, will fade away drifting further every day getting lost within myself nothing matters, no one else i have lost the will to live simply nothing more to give there is nothing more for me need the end to set me free things are not what they used to be missing one inside of me deathly lost, this can't be real can't stand this hell i feel emptiness is filling me to the point of agony growing darkness taking dawn i was me, but now he's gone no one but me can save myself, but it's too late now i can't think, think why i should even try yesterday seems as though it never existed death greets me warm, now i will just say goodbye
