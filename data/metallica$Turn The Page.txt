on a long and lonesome highway east of omaha you can listen to the engines moanin' out its one old song you think about the woman or the girl you knew the night before but your thoughts will soon be wandering the way they always do when you're riding sixteen hours and there's nothing much to do and you don't feel much like riding, you just wish the trip wasthrough here i am, on the road again there i am, up on the stage here i go, playing star again there i go, turn the page so you walk into this restaurant strung out from the road and you feel the eyes upon you, as you're shaking off the cold you pretend it doesn't bother you, but you just want to explode yeah, most times you can't hear 'em talk, other times you can all the same old clich√©s: is it woman? is it man? and you always seem outnumbered, you don't dare make a stand make your stand here i am, on the road again there i am, up on the stage here i go, playing star again there i go, turn the page oo-ooh, out there in the spotlight, you're a million miles away every ounce of energy you try to give away as the sweat pours out your body like the music that you play,yeah later in the evening, you lie awake in bed with the echoes of the amplifiers ringing in your head you smoke the day's last cigarette, remembering what she said what she said he-ey yeah and here i am, on the road again there i am, up on a stage here i go, playing star again there i go, turn the page there i go, turn that page there i go, yeah, yeah there i go, yeah, yeah there i go, yeah there i go, yeah there i go, oo-oo-ooh there i go and i'm gone
