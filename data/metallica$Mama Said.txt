mama, she has taught me well told me when i was young son, your life's an open book don't close it 'fore it's done the brightest flame burns quickest that's what i heard her say a son's heart's owned to mother but i must find my way let my heart go let your son grow mama, let my heart go or let this heart be still yeah, still rebel, my new last name wild blood in my veins apron strings around my neck the mark that still remains left home at an early age of what i heard was wrong i never asked forgiveness but what i said is done let my heart go let your son grow mama, let my heart go or let this heart be still never i ask of you but never i gave but you gave me your emptiness i now take to my grave never i ask of you but never i gave but you gave me your emptiness i now take to my grave so let this heart be still mama, now i'm coming home i'm not all you wished of me but a mother's love for her son unspoken, help me be yeah, i took your love for granted and all the things you said to me i need your arms to welcome me but a cold stone's all i see let my heart go let your son grow mama, let my heart go or let this heart be still let my heart go mama, let my heart go you never let my heart go so let this heart be still never i ask of you but never i gave but you gave me your emptiness i now take to my grave so let this heart be still
